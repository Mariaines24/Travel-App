# Travel-App
This application was developed in Kotlin for android. This has several functions. </br> Initially, the user can either add a place that they have already visited or are going to visit. You have to enter the name of the place, the date range of the visit, a short description and rate the place. Optionally, the user can add an image. As new locations are added, they appear, ordered by starting date in descending order, that is, from the most recent to the oldest. </br> Furthermore, the Google Maps API was included and therefore, the user has access to the world map in this application where they can see their current location, search for places (with the help of the places API) and add markers, where they have to associate a name, a date range and a short description. All added markers can be viewed and filtered according to the person's interest, they can see upcoming events or define a date range.
